	<h2> A Little Bit About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Brandon Jewik. I’m a 13 year old, 
	currently attending Carmenita Middle SchoolI play 
	the violin, piano, and just recently learned guitar 
	this past summer. I’ve also learned various programming 
	languages; HTML, CSS, Python, and Java Script. Using 
	CSS and HTML, I was able to decide my own website,
	<a href="https://jewikbj.github.io/" target="_blank">
	My Website</a>, the website you're on now.I was a volunteer 
	at the City of Cerritos this past summer. I was able to 
	volunteer at different occasions such as Concert Night 
	under the Stars at Heritage Park. I did many fun activities
	with the kids at the Park such as Soccer, Tag, Relay Races 
	and others. I’ve had a passion for video editing or photo editing.
	I’ve enjoyed cloning two of me in the same picture and doing video
 edits like spin changing or snap changing.
I also really love basically any outdoor activities like jogging and 
tennis. I love breathing the fresh air and the wind when I’m jogging, 
and the quickness of tennis. These things are more of a hobby like when
 I’ve just been working on an assignment for 5 hours straight and I need to take
 a quick break.
