  <h3>Here's a Little About Me: </h3>
     <p>I play the violin, piano, and just recently learned guitar this past summer. Iâ€™ve also learned various programming languages; HTML, CSS, Python, and Java Script. Using CSS and HTML, I was able to decide my own website,<a href="https://jewikbj.github.io/" target="_blank"> My Website</a>, the website you're on now.</p>
